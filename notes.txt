the difference between React and React-DOM :

React: React is a javascript library, designed for building better user interfaces.

React-DOM: React-DOM is a complimentary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM

In a nutshell, Whenever we use component, classes, elements, etc. We’re using React and whenever we use methods like render() or findDOMNode() we’re using React-DOM.

The Split
Why did the React team decide to split React and React-DOM into two different libraries?

Because React-DOM binds the idea of React to a web browser. And ideally, React has nothing to do with a browser or web for that matter. That’s why we’re seeing tools and frameworks like React-Native, React-Three being developed. These tools and frameworks don’t use React-DOM, but they do in fact use the idea behind React.

This is what the team had to say when they were splitting these two libraries

As we look at packages like react-native, react-art, react-canvas, and react-three, it's become clear that the beauty and essence of React has nothing to do with browsers or the DOM.

To make this more clear and to make it easier to build more environments that React can render to, we’re splitting the main react package into two: react and react-dom.
The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds.

The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine. The production build runs uglify and builds your source files into one or multiple minimized files.
WHAT IS AYNC AND DEFER:

Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. 

Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading
